# Iris Flower Classification - InfoaidTech Machine Learning Intern Task (aidTech_Iris_Flower_Classification)

## Introduction

This machine learning project is designed to classify the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal length and width. We will follow a step-by-step approach to build and evaluate our classification models.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Load the Iris Dataset

We will start by loading the Iris dataset into our Python environment. The dataset contains information about the sepal and petal dimensions of three different species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

### 2. Import scikit-learn

To create and train our machine learning models, we'll import scikit-learn, a powerful library for machine learning in Python.

### 3. Pre-processing the Dataset

Before building and training our models, we need to split the dataset into training and testing sets. This separation is essential to evaluate the models' performance accurately.

### 4. Understanding the Dataset

We will gain insights into the dataset by visualizing the data using scatterplots and histograms. These visualizations will help us understand the relationships between different features and the distribution of data.

### 5. Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees

We will implement two classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. These algorithms will be used to predict the iris flower species based on the input features.

### 6. Training the Models

The next step involves training our KNN and Decision Tree models using the training data. We will tune the hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance.

### 7. Visualizing Model Performance

We will visualize the performance of our trained models on the testing set. This includes creating confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves to assess model accuracy.

### 8. Testing on Custom Data

Finally, we will test our trained models on custom data to see how well they can classify iris flowers with real-world inputs.
